# monte carlo simulation / estimation

- this is a  repository created for fed_shap value procect
- the goal is to gain compelete insight about TMC-shap algorithm
  - so I will implement monte carlo on a toy example at first
  - then I try to understand the montecalro algo usage in the context of data evaluation(ai fairness)
